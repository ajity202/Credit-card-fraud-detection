**Overview**

A data science project focused on detecting fraudulent credit card transactions using machine learning. The system leverages data preprocessing, feature scaling, and class imbalance handling (using SMOTE) to improve fraud detection accuracy.

The project compares Logistic Regression and Random Forest models, using performance metrics like Precision, Recall, and F1-Score to evaluate effectiveness on an imbalanced dataset.

**Highlights**

Preprocessed and analyzed over 280,000 transactions.

Balanced data using SMOTE to enhance model performance.

Random Forest achieved the best balance with:

Recall: 0.81

Precision: 0.81

F1-Score: 0.81

**Key Learnings**

Managing imbalanced datasets effectively.

Selecting the right evaluation metrics for fraud detection.

Balancing model accuracy and real-world applicability.

**Tech Stack**

Python • Scikit-learn • Pandas • NumPy • Matplotlib • Imbalanced-learn • Jupyter Notebook

**Future Scope**

Implement advanced models (XGBoost, LightGBM).

Perform hyperparameter tuning for optimization.

Deploy model using Flask or FastAPI for real-time fraud prediction.
